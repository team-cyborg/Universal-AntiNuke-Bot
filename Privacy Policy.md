# Privacy Policy

### Usage of Data

> The bot may use stored data, as defined in Terms of Service, for different features including but not limited to: AntiNuke System (when enabled) and command handling.
> 
> No usage of data outside of the aformentioned cases will happen and the data is not shared with any 3rd-party site or service.

### Stored Information

> The bot may store the following information automatically when being invited to a new Discord Server (`<custom>` means the value is set by you during setting up the bot for the server):
> 
> - `guild_id` with the Guild Id as value.
> - `language` with value `EN`.
> - `prefix` with value `u!`.
> - `guild_antinuke_settings` with value `<custom>`.
> 
> **NOTE: No other information will be stored.**

### Updating Data

> The data may be updated when using specific commands.
> Updating data will require the input of an user, and data that can be seen as sensitive, such as how antinuke should work, may need to be stored when using certain commands.
> 
> No other actions may update the stored information at any given time.

### Temporarely stored Information

> The Bot may keep the stored information in a database for a certain amount of time.
> After this time period, the cached information will be dropped and only be re-added when required.
> 
> Data may be dropped from database pre-maturely through actions such as removing the bot from the Server.

### Removal of Data

<details>
  <summary>Automatic removal</summary>
  
  Stored Data can be removed automatically through means of removing the bot from a Guild. This can be achieved by either kicking or banning the bot from the server. Re-inviting the bot will add the same default values, as mentioned above, back to the bot's database.
</details>

<details>
  <summary>Manual removal</summary>
  
  Manual removal of the data can be requested through email at devinsane.79@gmail.com or at our [Discord Server](https://discord.gg/sGjrd49eMK).
  For security reasons we will ask you to provide us with proof of ownership of the server, that you wish the data to be removed of. Only a server owner may request manual removal of data and requesting it will result in the bot being removed from the server, if still present on it.
